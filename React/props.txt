What Are Props in React?

👉 Props are read-only inputs passed from one component 
(usually a parent to child).
👉 They allow components to be reusable by accepting different inputs.

Example:

function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

// Usage
<Greeting name="Alice" />
<Greeting name="Bob" />

What Is Props Drilling?

👉 Props drilling happens when data is passed 
from a top-level component down to a deeply nested component 
through multiple layers of intermediate components 
that do not need the data themselves, 
but are only used to pass it down.

Example of Props Drilling:

function App() {
  return <Parent name="Alice" />;
}

function Parent({ name }) {
  return <Child name={name} />;
}

function Child({ name }) {
  return <Grandchild name={name} />;
}

function Grandchild({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;
}

App → Parent → Child → Grandchild

👉 The name prop is needed only in Grandchild, 
but it must be passed through each intermediate component.

Why Props Drilling Can Be a Problem

👉 Makes components harder to maintain.

👉 Leads to bloated function signatures.

👉 Reduces reusability of intermediate components.
