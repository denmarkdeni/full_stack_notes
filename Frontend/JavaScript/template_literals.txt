What are Template Literals?

👉 Template literals are strings enclosed by backticks (`), 
not quotes (' or ").

👉 They let you embed variables, expressions, 
and even multi-line strings easily.

Basic Example

    let name = "Denny";
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
    Output: Hello, Denny!

Expression Interpolation

    let a = 5, b = 10;
    console.log(`Sum of ${a} and ${b} is ${a + b}`);
    Output: Sum of 5 and 10 is 15

Multi-line Strings (no need for \n)

    let poem = `Roses are red,
    Violets are blue,
    JavaScript is fun,
    And so are you!`;

    console.log(poem);

Nesting & Function Calls

    function greet(name) {
    return `Hi ${name}, welcome!`;
    }

    console.log(`${greet("Buddy")}`);
