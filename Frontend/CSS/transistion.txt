🔹 What is a CSS Transition?

A CSS transition allows property changes in CSS values 
to occur smoothly over a specified duration.

🔹 Transition Properties

Here are the 4 main components (types) of CSS transitions:

transition-property
    Specifies the CSS property to which the transition is applied 
    (e.g., `background-color`, `width`). 
    Use `all` to apply to all changeable properties.

transition-duration
    Defines how long the transition takes to complete 
    (e.g., `0.5s`, `1s`). 

transition-timing-function
    Describes how the intermediate values 
    of the transition are calculated 
    (e.g., `ease`, `linear`).

transition-delay 
    Sets a delay before the transition starts (e.g., `0.2s`).      

Use transition to animate CSS property changes smoothly.

Main properties:

    transition-property

    transition-duration

    transition-timing-function

    transition-delay

using shorthand: transition: all 0.5s ease-in-out 0s;

🔹 What is transform in CSS?

transform is a CSS property that lets you visually manipulate an element:
move it, rotate it, resize it, or skew it — even all at once.


| Function      | Purpose              | Example                       |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `scale()`     | Resize (zoom in/out) | `scale(1.2)`                  |
| `rotate()`    | Rotate element       | `rotate(45deg)`               |
| `translate()` | Move element         | `translate(50px, 20px)`       |
| `skew()`      | Slant element        | `skew(20deg)`                 |
