🎯 Positioning in CSS

👉 The position property tells the browser 
how an element should be placed in the document.

Along with position, we often use:

👉 top
👉 right
👉 bottom
👉 left
👉 z-index
    The z-index property controls the stacking order of elements 
    (which element appears on top when they overlap).

    Works only on positioned elements

        👉 That means the element must have position:
         relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky.

        👉 If position: static (default), z-index won’t work.

    Higher value = on top

        👉 z-index: 10 will be above z-index: 5.

    Default value is auto (0)

🧩 Five Types :

1. Static (default)

👉 Elements are positioned naturally in the flow.
(top to bottom, left to right)

div {
  position: static; /* default */
}

👉 Ignores top, left, right, bottom.

2. Relative

👉 Element stays in normal flow, 
but you can shift it relative to itself.

.box {
  position: relative;
  top: 20px;
  left: 10px;
}

👉 Moves 20px down, 10px right from its original place.

👉 Still takes up original space in the layout.

3. Absolute

👉 Element is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.
(not static)

.box {
  position: absolute;
  top: 10px;
  left: 20px; 
}

👉 Removed from normal flow (other elements ignore it).

👉 If no parent is positioned, 
it uses the <html> (body) as reference. 

Difference Between Relative and Absolute:
  Relative : 
    position from itselt
    have space in parent
  Absolute:
    position from positioned parent
    have no space in parent

4. Fixed

👉 Element is fixed relative to the viewport (screen).

.navbar {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  width: 100%;
}
👉 Stays in place when scrolling.

👉 Useful for navbars, floating buttons, etc.

5. Sticky

👉 Hybrid of relative + fixed.

.header {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
}

👉 Acts like relative until you scroll.

👉 Once it reaches top: 0, it sticks like fixed.

⚡ Visual Recap:

| Position   | Reference                 | Stays in Flow?  | Example Use         |
| ---------- | ------------------------- | --------------  | ------------------- |
| `static`   | Normal flow               | ✅              | Default behavior    |
| `relative` | Itself                    | ✅              | Nudge slightly      |
| `absolute` | Nearest positioned parent | ❌              | Tooltips, modals    |
| `fixed`    | Viewport                  | ❌              | Sticky navbars      |
| `sticky`   | Scroll position           | ✅ until stuck  | Headers, table rows |
