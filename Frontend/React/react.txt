🧩 What is React?

React is a JavaScript library (not a full framework) 
created by Facebook (Meta).

It helps developers build user interfaces (UIs), 
especially for web apps.

Its main power is handling dynamic, interactive, 
and reusable components.

Instead of reloading the whole page, 
React updates only the parts of the UI 
that need to change (using something called the Virtual DOM).

🧩 Why are we using React?

Component-Based

    You can break your UI into small, reusable pieces 
    Example: Button, Navbar, Footer → all can be reused.

Virtual DOM = Fast Updates 

    Instead of changing the whole webpage, 
    React quickly updates only the changed part → very fast performance.

Reusable Code 

    Once you build a component, you can reuse it everywhere.
    Saves time + makes projects more maintainable.

Strong Community & Ecosystem 

    Millions of developers use it. 
    Tons of tutorials, packages, and support.

Used by Big Companies

    Facebook, Instagram, Netflix, Airbnb, WhatsApp Web all use React.
    Learning React gives you industry-standard skills.
