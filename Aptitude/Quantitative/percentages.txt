🧩 Answers with Explanations:

    A) 168.75

20% = 45 → 100% = 45 × 5 = 225 → 75% = 225 × 0.75 = 168.75

    B) $1000

After 20% discount, price = 80% of original.
80% of original = 800 → Original = 800 ÷ 0.8 = 1000

    A) 4,200

A got 65% → B got 35% → 35% of 12,000 = 0.35 × 12000 = 4200

    A) 120

125% of original = 150 → Original = 150 ÷ 1.25 = 120

    B) $52.17

Selling price = Cost price × 1.15
60 = CP × 1.15 → CP = 60 ÷ 1.15 ≈ 52.17

    C) 1% decrease

Let original = 100
After 10% increase → 110
After 10% decrease → 110 × 0.9 = 99
Net decrease = 1%

    B) 40

Boys = 60% of total, girls = 40%
60% = 24 → Total = 24 ÷ 0.6 = 40

    A) 20%

Ratio 4:1 → Total parts = 5 → Water = 1/5 = 20%

    A) 2 : 1

0.15x = 0.30y → x/y = 30/15 = 2/1 → 2:1

    A) 80% and 72%

First: 72/90 × 100 = 80%
Second: 72/100 × 100 = 72%

he can save ₹11,200. What is his new salary?
A) ₹44,800  B) ₹48,000  C) ₹56,000  D) ₹60,000

1.Answer & Trick: A) 357
15% = 63 → 5% = 21 → 1% = 21 ÷ 5 = 4.2 → 100% = 420 → 85% = 420 × 0.85 = 357

2.Answer & Trick: B) ₹800
After 25% discount → 75% of MP = 600
So 75% = 600 → divide by 3 → 25% = 200 → 100% = 800

3.Answer & Trick: A) 400
Work backwards:
Final = 408 → after 15% decrease means it was 408 ÷ 0.85
408 ÷ 0.85 = 480 (after increase)
480 was after 20% increase → original = 480 ÷ 1.2 = 400

4.Answer & Trick: B) 9
80% passed → 20% failed
80% = 36 → 20% = 9 students failed in Maths

5.Answer & Trick: A) ₹44,800
Now he spends only 75% of new salary and saves 25%.
Savings = 25% of new salary = 11,200
25% = 11,200 → 100% = 11,200 × 4 = ₹44,800
