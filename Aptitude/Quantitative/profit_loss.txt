Answers:

1. c) 33.33%

2. b) $400

Explanation: Let CP = x. SP at 10% profit = 1.1x.
If sold for $20 more, SP = 1.1x + 20, profit 15% so 1.15x.
Equation: 1.1x + 20 = 1.15x → 20 = 0.05x → x = 20 / 0.05 = $400.

3. c) 25%
Explanation: Let SP per kg = s, CP per kg = c.
SP for 45 kg = 45s, profit = 45s - 45c = 9s (gains SP of 9 kg).
45s - 45c = 9s → 36s = 45c → s/c = 45/36 = 5/4 = 1.25.
Profit % = (s - c)/c 100 = 0.25100 = 25%.

4. a) 4% loss
Explanation: Let CP1 = x, then SP1 = 1.2x (20% profit).
CP2 = y, SP2 = 0.8y (20% loss). But both SP = $240, so 1.2x = 240 → x = 200.
0.8y = 240 → y = 300.
Total CP = 200 + 300 = 500, total SP = 480. Loss = 20, % = (20/500)*100 = 4% loss.

5. b) 11.11%
Explanation: He uses 900g but charges for 1000g. For every 1000g charged, he gives 900g, so cost is for 900g but sells as 1000g at CP.
Let CP per kg = c. He buys 900g for 0.9c, sells as 1kg for c (at "CP").
Profit = c - 0.9c = 0.1c, % = (0.1c / 0.9c)*100 = (1/9)*100 ≈ 11.11%.

6. b) $133.33
Explanation: MP = $200, discount 20%, SP = 200 * 0.8 = $160.
Profit 20%, so SP = 1.2 * CP → 160 = 1.2 CP → CP = 160 / 1.2 ≈ $133.33.

7. a) 40%
Explanation: Let original price = 100. After 20% discount: 100 * 0.8 = 80.
Then 25% on 80: 80 * 0.75 = 60.
Total discount = 100 - 60 = 40, so 40%. (Formula: 1 - (1-0.2)(1-0.25) = 1 - 0.8*0.75 = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4 = 40%).

8. b) $20
Explanation: First sale: Profit = $80 - $70 = $10.
Second buy and sale: Profit = $100 - $90 = $10.
Total profit = $10 + $10 = $20. (The buy back is a separate transaction; net effect is like two independent profits).
