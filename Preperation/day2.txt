⚙️ 1. Command Prompt (Terminal Basics)

What is a Command Prompt?

The Command Prompt is a text-based interface 
used to interact with your computer.
Instead of clicking icons, you type commands to perform actions 
like creating folders, viewing files, or navigating directories.

Why it’s Important:

Helps developers and system admins work faster.
Used for coding, testing, running scripts, and managing files.

Basic Commands

dir   - Lists files and folders in the current directory
cd    - Changes the current directory
mkdir - Creates a new folder (directory)
cls   - Clears the terminal screen

⚙️ 2. What is a Compiler?

A compiler is a program that translates source code (written by humans) 
into machine code (understood by the computer) — all at once.

Example:

When you write a C program, 
the compiler translates it into a file the computer can execute.

⚙️ Compiler vs Interpreter

| Feature           | Compiler                         | Interpreter                   |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Translation       | Converts the entire code at once | Converts line by line         |
| Speed             | Faster execution                 | Slower execution              |
| Error Detection   | Shows all errors after compiling | Stops when first error occurs |
| Example Languages | C, C++                           | Python, JavaScript            |
