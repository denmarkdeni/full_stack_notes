🌐 Basic Understanding of Programming

Programming is the process of giving instructions 
to a computer so it can perform specific tasks.

🌐 Key Programming Concepts

1. Variables

A variable is like a box that stores a value.
You can change the value anytime.

name = "Arjun" --> declaration 
name = "Arun"
Pi = 3.14
print(name)
System.out.println(name)
console.log(name)

2. Data Types

Data types define the kind of data stored in a variable.

| Type    | Example           | Description             |
| ------- | ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| `int`   | `10`              | Integer (whole numbers) |
| `float` | `12.5`            | Decimal number          |
| `str`   | `"Hello"`         | String (text)           |
| `bool`  | `True` or `False` | Boolean (yes/no value)  |

3. Conditional Statements (if–else)

Used to make decisions in your program.

age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")

4. Loops

Loops are used to repeat tasks multiple times.

for i in range(5):
    print("Hello!", i)


5. Functions 

Block of code can be reuse when we call 

function greet(){
    code 
    code 
    code
}
greet()

6. Class & Object ( OOPS )

blueprint of entity 

class Bike :
    tyre = True
    wheel = True

ktm = Bike();
ktm.tyre = false
