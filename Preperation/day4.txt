🌐 Introduction to Frontend Development

The Frontend is the part of a website or web application 
that users can see and interact with directly.
Everything you click, type, or watch on a website 
— buttons, text boxes, images, menus — is part of the frontend.

1. HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

HTML is the structure or skeleton of a web page.
It tells the browser what content to display 
— headings, paragraphs, images, links, etc.

2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

CSS is used to style your HTML 
— colors, fonts, layouts, and animations.

3. JavaScript (JS)

JavaScript makes the webpage interactive and dynamic.
It allows users to click buttons, move sliders, show alerts, 
or load data instantly without refreshing the page.

Simple Explanation:

HTML loads the structure → shows content.
CSS makes it look attractive → colors and layout.
JavaScript adds behavior → animations, clicks, and logic.


🌐 Introduction to Backend Development

The Backend is the brain of any application.
It’s the part users can’t see, but it’s what makes everything work.

It handles:

Logic: How data should behave (like calculations or decision-making).

Business Rules: What should happen when certain actions occur.

Data Communication: Sending and receiving data between the user 
(frontend) and the server (database).

⚙️ Frontend vs Backend

| Feature   | Frontend              | Backend                             |
| --------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Works on  | Browser               | Server                              |
| Role      | What user sees        | What user doesn’t see (logic, data) |
| Languages | HTML, CSS, JavaScript | Python, PHP, Java, Node.js          |
| Example   | Login form UI         | Checking if login is correct        |


🌐 API stands for Application Programming Interface.

It’s like a messenger that allows two systems to talk to each other.

Simple Example:

When you use a weather app:

The app (frontend) sends a request to a weather server (backend API).
The API returns data like temperature, humidity, forecast, etc.
Your app then displays that info in a friendly design.

Frontend (User) ⇄ API ⇄ Backend Server ⇄ Database

Real-World Examples of APIs

| Example         | How it works                                                       |
| ----------------| ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Google Maps API | Websites can show maps and locations using Google’s data.          |
| Razorpay API    | E-commerce sites use it for online payments.                       |
| Weather API     | Apps display current weather info fetched from servers.            |
| YouTube API     | Developers can show videos or data from YouTube on their own apps. |
