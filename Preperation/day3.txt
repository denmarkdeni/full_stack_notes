⚙️ Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The SDLC is the process developers follow 
to plan, design, build, test, and deliver software efficiently.
It ensures the project is successful, on time, and meets user needs.

⚙️ Phases of SDLC

| Phase                    | Description                                        | Example (To-Do List App)                                            |
| -------------------------| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Requirement Gathering | Understand what the user needs.                    | App should let users add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete. |
| 2. Design                | Plan how the app looks and how data flows.         | Create wireframes or sketches of the to-do list screen.             |
| 3. Development           | Write the actual code using programming languages. | Code the front-end (HTML/CSS/React) and back-end (Python/Django).   |
| 4. Testing               | Check if the app works correctly and has no bugs.  | Test if tasks save, delete, and update properly.                    |
| 5. Deployment            | Make the app live for users to access.             | Host it on a web server or Play Store.                              |
| 6. Maintenance           | Fix issues and update features after release.      | Add “Dark Mode” or “Reminder Notification” in future versions.      |
