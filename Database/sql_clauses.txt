1. Clauses

WHERE
👉 Filter rows
👉 WHERE price > 100

ORDER BY
👉 Sort results (ASC or DESC)
👉 ORDER BY name DESC

LIMIT
👉 Limit number of returned rows
👉 LIMIT 10

OFFSET
👉 Skip a number of rows 
👉 LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20

GROUP BY
👉 Group rows with same values
👉 GROUP BY customer_id

HAVING
👉 Filter groups after aggregation
👉 HAVING COUNT(*) > 5

>>>> Execution order

WHERE → GROUP BY → HAVING → ORDER BY → LIMIT/OFFSET


2. Arithmetic Operators

+
👉 Addition
👉 price + 500

-
👉 Subtraction
👉 price - discount

*
👉 Multiplication
👉 quantity * price

/
👉 Division
👉 total / quantity

%
👉 Modulus (remainder)
👉 id % 2 = 0


3. Comparison Operators

=
👉 Equal to
👉 status = 'active'

!= or <>
👉 Not equal to
👉 price != 100

<   >
👉 Less than / Greater than
👉 price > 50

<=   >=
👉 Less than or equal / Greater than or equal
👉 price >= 100

BETWEEN
👉 Within inclusive range
👉 price BETWEEN 50 AND 200

IN
👉 Match any value in list
👉 id IN (1, 5, 10)

LIKE
👉 Pattern matching with wildcards
👉 name LIKE 'A%'

IS NULL
👉 Check for NULL value
👉 email IS NULL

IS NOT NULL
👉 Check for non-NULL value
👉 phone IS NOT NULL


4. Logical Operators

AND
👉 Both conditions must be true
👉 price > 100 AND stock > 0

OR
👉 Any one condition true
👉 category = 'A' OR category = 'B'

NOT
👉 Reverse the condition
👉 NOT status = 'inactive'


5. LIKE Wildcards

%
👉 Zero or more characters
👉 'A%' → starts with A

_
👉 Exactly one character
👉 'A__' → 3 letters starting with A

>>>> Examples

WHERE name LIKE 'A_a%'      -- A then any char, then a, then anything 
WHERE name LIKE '%ing'      -- ends with "ing"
WHERE name LIKE '%o%a%'     -- contains o and a
WHERE name NOT LIKE 'A__'   -- not 3-letter names starting with A


6. Filtering Keywords

BETWEEN
👉 Inclusive range
👉 price BETWEEN 100 AND 500

NOT BETWEEN
👉 Outside the range
👉 price NOT BETWEEN 10 AND 50

IN
👉 Match any value from list
👉 status IN ('active', 'pending')

NOT IN
👉 Not in the list
👉 id NOT IN (1, 3, 5)

IS NULL
👉 Field is NULL
👉 email IS NULL

IS NOT NULL
👉 Field has value
👉 phone IS NOT NULL

DISTINCT
👉 Remove duplicate rows/values
👉 SELECT DISTINCT city FROM customers


7. Sorting

ORDER BY column ASC
👉 Sort ascending (default)
👉 ORDER BY name

ORDER BY column DESC
👉 Sort descending
👉 ORDER BY price DESC

ORDER BY col1, col2
👉 Sort by multiple columns
👉 ORDER BY price DESC, name ASC


8. Aggregate Functions

COUNT(*)
👉 Count all rows
👉 COUNT(*)

COUNT(column)
👉 Count non-NULL values
👉 COUNT(email)

SUM(column)
👉 Total sum
👉 SUM(amount)

AVG(column)
👉 Average value
👉 AVG(price)

MIN(column)
👉 Minimum value
👉 MIN(salary)

MAX(column)
👉 Maximum value
👉 MAX(order_date)


9. WHERE vs HAVING

WHERE
👉 Filters individual rows BEFORE grouping
👉 Cannot use aggregate functions

HAVING
👉 Filters grouped results AFTER aggregation
👉 Can use COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.

>>>> Examples

SELECT 
    customer_id, 
    SUM(amount) AS total_spent
FROM orders
WHERE amount > 100              -- Step 1: Remove small orders
GROUP BY customer_id            -- Step 2: Group remaining rows
HAVING SUM(amount) > 400        -- Step 3: Keep only big spenders
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;


10. Common Functions

>>>> String Functions

CONCAT()
👉 Join strings
👉 CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name)

UPPER()
👉 Convert to uppercase
👉 UPPER('hello') → HELLO

LOWER()
👉 Convert to lowercase
👉 LOWER('HELLO') → hello

LENGTH()
👉 Length of string
👉 LENGTH('hello') → 5

SUBSTRING()
👉 Extract part of string
👉 SUBSTRING('HelloWorld', 1, 5) → Hello

>>>> Date Functions

NOW()
👉 Current date and time
👉 NOW()

CURDATE()
👉 Current date only

>>>> Math Functions

ROUND()
👉 Round number
👉 ROUND(65.536, 1) → 65.5

11. Alias (AS)

AS
👉 Rename column or table
👉 SELECT name AS product_name FROM products

👉 Without AS (space also works)
👉 SELECT name product_name FROM products p
