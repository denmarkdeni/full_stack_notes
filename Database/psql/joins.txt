🔑 What is a JOIN in SQL?

A JOIN is used in SQL to combine rows from two or more tables 
based on a related column between them 
(usually a primary key – foreign key relationship).

🔑 Why JOIN is important?

Real-world databases don’t keep all information in one big table.

Instead, data is split into multiple related tables.

JOIN lets us combine data logically whenever we need.

🔑 Example:

INSERT INTO students (name, class_id) VALUES
('John', 101),
('Alice', 102),
('Bob', 103),
('Emma', NULL);

INSERT INTO classes (class_id, class_name) VALUES
(101, 'Physics'),
(102, 'Chemistry'),
(104, 'Biology');

🔑 INNER JOIN

Returns only rows with matching values in both tables.

SELECT s.student_id, s.name, c.class_name
FROM students s
INNER JOIN classes c
ON s.class_id = c.class_id;

student_id | name  | class_name
-----------+-------+-----------
1          | John  | Physics
2          | Alice | Chemistry

🔑 LEFT JOIN

Returns all rows from the left table (students),
with NULL if no match in classes.

SELECT s.student_id, s.name, c.class_name
FROM students s
LEFT JOIN classes c
ON s.class_id = c.class_id;

student_id | name  | class_name
-----------+-------+-----------
1          | John  | Physics
2          | Alice | Chemistry
3          | Bob   | NULL
4          | Emma  | NULL

🔑 RIGHT JOIN

Returns all rows from the right table (classes), 
with NULL if no match in students.

SELECT s.student_id, s.name, c.class_name
FROM students s
RIGHT JOIN classes c
ON s.class_id = c.class_id;

student_id | name  | class_name
-----------+-------+-----------
1          | John  | Physics
2          | Alice | Chemistry
NULL       | NULL  | Biology

🔑 FULL OUTER JOIN

Returns all rows when there is a match in either table.

SELECT s.student_id, s.name, c.class_name
FROM students s
FULL JOIN classes c
ON s.class_id = c.class_id;

student_id | name  | class_name
-----------+-------+-----------
1          | John  | Physics
2          | Alice | Chemistry
3          | Bob   | NULL
4          | Emma  | NULL
NULL       | NULL  | Biology

🔑 SELF JOIN

A table joined with itself.

SELECT a.name AS student1, b.name AS student2, a.class_id
FROM students a
JOIN students b
ON a.class_id = b.class_id
AND a.student_id < b.student_id;

student1 | student2 | class_id
---------+----------+----------
John     | Alice    | 101

🔑 Summary

INNER JOIN → Only matches

LEFT JOIN → All from left + matches

RIGHT JOIN → All from right + matches

FULL JOIN → All rows from both sides

SELF JOIN → Join table to itself
