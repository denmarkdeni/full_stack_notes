Database
	👉 A database is an organized collection of data 
	that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.
	👉 MySQL supports ACID.

		Atomicity	- Transaction = one complete unit
		Consistency	- Database must follow rules always
		Isolation	- Transactions don’t disturb each other
		Durability	- Saved data is permanent

		🌟 Simple Memory Trick

		All or nothing
		Correct rules
		Independent operations
		Data never lost

Why we need databases:
	👉 To store large amounts of data safely.
	👉 To retrieve and update data quickly.
	
Relational Database
	👉 Stores data in tables (rows & columns). 
	👉 Uses relationships (foreign keys).
	👉 MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle
	👉 Banking, ERP, Student systems
	
Non Relational Database
	👉 Stores data in non-tabular form (documents, key-value, graphs). 
	👉 Used for flexibility and scalability.
	👉 MongoDB, Firebase, Cassandra, Redis
	👉 Social media, IoT, real-time analytics
	
SQL(Structured Query Language)

	👉 SQL is a standard language used to communicate with relational databases.
	
Purpose:
	👉 Create databases and tables.
	👉 Insert, update, delete data.
	👉 Query (retrieve) data.
	👉 Control access and permissions.

Normalization is a process of organizing data in a database.

	👉 There is no duplicate data
	👉 Data is stored logically
	👉 Updates become easy and accurate
	👉 Storage is efficient
