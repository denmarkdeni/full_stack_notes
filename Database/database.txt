Database
	👉 A database is an organized collection of data 
	that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.

Why we need databases:
	👉 To store large amounts of data safely.
	👉 To retrieve and update data quickly.
	
Relational Database
	👉 Stores data in tables (rows & columns). 
	👉 Uses relationships (foreign keys).
	👉 MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle
	👉 Banking, ERP, Student systems
	
Non Relational Database
	👉 Stores data in non-tabular form (documents, key-value, graphs). 
	👉 Used for flexibility and scalability.
	👉 MongoDB, Firebase, Cassandra, Redis
	👉 Social media, IoT, real-time analytics
	
SQL(Structured Query Language)

	👉 SQL is a standard language used to communicate with relational databases.
	
Purpose:
	👉 Create databases and tables.
	👉 Insert, update, delete data.
	👉 Query (retrieve) data.
	👉 Control access and permissions.
