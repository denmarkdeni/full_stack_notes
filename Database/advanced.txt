1️⃣ Set Operators

UNION vs UNION ALL

INTERSECT (not in MySQL, workaround with INNER JOIN)

2️⃣ Subqueries (Nested Queries)

  Query inside another query.

Types:

  Scalar subquery (returns 1 value)

  Row subquery (returns 1 row)

  Table subquery (used with IN, EXISTS)

Example:

  SELECT name FROM students
  WHERE class_id IN (SELECT class_id FROM classes 
  WHERE class_name = 'Physics');

3️⃣ Views

  A saved query that behaves like a table.

  Great for reusable queries & simplifying reports.

Example:

  CREATE VIEW class_summary AS
  SELECT class_id, COUNT(*) AS student_count
  FROM students
  GROUP BY class_id;

4️⃣ Indexes

  Boost query performance.

Types:

  Single-column index

  Composite index

  Unique index

Example:

  CREATE INDEX idx_class_id ON students(class_id);

5️⃣ Stored Procedures & Functions

  Encapsulate SQL logic for reuse.

Example (procedure):

  DELIMITER //
  CREATE PROCEDURE get_students_by_class(IN cid INT)
  BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM students WHERE class_id = cid;
  END //
  DELIMITER ;

6️⃣ Window Functions (Analytical Functions) 💯 (very important for analytics)

Add powerful reporting tools:

  ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK()

  OVER(PARTITION BY ...)

  Running totals, moving averages.

Example:

  SELECT name, class_id,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY class_id ORDER BY student_id) AS rank_in_class
  FROM students;

7️⃣ Advanced Filtering

CASE WHEN for conditional logic.

Complex WHERE with nested conditions.

8️⃣ Data Import/Export

Loading data from CSV/Excel (LOAD DATA INFILE).

Exporting results for reporting.
